## ✅ How to Use This

1. Create a folder `solutions/`  
2. Save each `.sql` file using the format: `01-problem-name.sql`  
3. Update the `Status` to:
   - `✅` for completed
   - `⏳` for in progress
   - `❌` for not started  
4. Add the file link under the **Solution** column like:  
   `[View](./solutions/01-average-time-of-process.sql)`
